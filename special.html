  <!-- CARD 1 -->
  <div class="special-card">
    <h2>🌸 What You Are</h2>
    <p>
      You are my calm in chaos,  
      my smile without reason,  
      and the thought that stays even in silence.
    </p>
  </div>

  <!-- CARD 2 -->
  <div class="special-card">
    <h2>✨ What You Changed</h2>
    <p>
      You made ordinary days feel meaningful.  
      You made me believe that love doesn’t need perfection —  
      just honesty.
    </p>
  </div>

  <!-- CARD 3 -->
  <div class="special-card">
    <h2>💖 What I Promise</h2>
    <p>
      To choose you — in happiness and in doubt.  
      To listen, to grow, and to stay.  
      Not just today… but always.
    </p>
  </div>

  <!-- CARD 4 -->
  <div class="special-card">
    <h2>🌙 When I Think of You</h2>
    <p>
      Even the quiet moments feel warm,  
      because somehow… you’re there.
    </p>
  </div>

  <!-- CARD 5 -->
  <div class="special-card">
    <h2>💫 Little Things</h2>
    <p>
      Your smile, your words, your presence —  
      they mean more than you know.
    </p>
  </div>

  <!-- CARD 6 -->
  <div class="special-card">
    <h2>🌷 What You Taught Me</h2>
    <p>
      That love is patience,  
      understanding,  
      and choosing each other every day.
    </p>
  </div>

  <!-- CARD 7 -->
  <div class="special-card">
    <h2>❤️ One Simple Truth</h2>
    <p>
      Life feels better, lighter, and brighter
